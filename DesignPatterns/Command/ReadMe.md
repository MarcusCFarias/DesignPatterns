### When to use:

The Command Pattern is beneficial when you need to decouple the sender and receiver of a request, allowing for flexible and extensible systems. 
It is useful for parameterizing objects with operations, supporting undo/redo functionality, and implementing transactions or callback mechanisms.

### Advantages:

- Undo/Redo Functionality
- Decoupling of Components
- Flexibility and Extensibility

### Disavantages:

- Increased Number of Classes
- Complexity for Simple Operations

### Example explained:

My example is a Sushi Restaurant which the customer send the command to the sushi chef.
