The Factory Pattern is appropriate in various scenarios where you need to create objects but want to decouple the object instantiation from the client code.


### Advantages:

- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Code Maintenance and Cetralized Logic

### Disavantages:

- Complexity
- Increase number of classes

### Example explained:

In my example a just used a Restaurant with multiple types of food. We can perceive that the Abstract Factory Pattern encompasses multiple Factory Methods.
