### When to use:

The Decorator Pattern is used when you need to add or augment the behavior of objects dynamically, at runtime, without altering their code. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to extend the functionalities of individual objects in a flexible and reusable way. 


### Advantages:

- Maintains Single Responsibility Principle
- Reusable Components

### Disavantages:

- Increased Number of Objects
- Ordering of Decorators
- Not Ideal for Every Scenario

### Example explained:

In my example a just used a Coffee Machine which the user could choose inomorous number of coffees.
