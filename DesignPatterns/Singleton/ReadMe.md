### When to use:

The Singleton pattern is used when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to that instance.


### Advantages:

- Single instance
- Lazy Initialization
- Global access

### Disavantages:

- Violates single responsibility principal
- Rigidity
- Difficult to subclass

### Example explained:

In my example a just used two types of singleton class, one with thread safe and other normal. Futhermore, you can see the instances in main class.
